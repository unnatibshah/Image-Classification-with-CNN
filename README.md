# Image-Classification-with-CNN
To create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, I will create and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. The same technique can be used to solve image classification problems on your own data as well.
